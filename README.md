# PySpark with Neural Networks

Pyspark implementation of Shallow Neural Network from scratch using MNIST.

The goal of this project is to use Spark to build a 3 layer Neural Network from Scratch, using my own mathematical formulas to solve an Image classification Task. I will use the very famous MNIST dataset
